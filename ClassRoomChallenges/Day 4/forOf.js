    - Using a for of loop, console.log the name of each pie from the

    - Have the conditional check if EACH pie from the pies array is of the type 'apple'.

    - Use google to search for an array method that checks if an array includes a certain value

*/

    apple pie is a fruit pie / chocolate peanut butter pie is not a fruit pie. 
    Then, using string interpolation, console.log either
